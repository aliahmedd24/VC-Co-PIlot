# Term Sheet Mechanics — Key Provisions Explained

## Economic Terms

### Valuation
- **Pre-money valuation**: Company value before investment
- **Post-money valuation**: Pre-money + investment amount
- Pre-money is negotiated; post-money is calculated

### Option Pool
- Typically 10-20% of post-money
- Created before the investment (dilutes founders, not new investors)
- "Option pool shuffle": increasing pool from 10% to 20% before a round effectively lowers founder ownership by 10%

### Liquidation Preference
Determines payout order in an exit event.

**1x Non-Participating (Standard)**
- Investor gets back their investment OR converts to common (whichever is higher)
- At low exit values: take the preference; at high exit values: convert

**1x Participating ("Double Dip")**
- Investor gets back their investment AND their pro-rata share of remaining proceeds
- Significantly more investor-favorable
- Sometimes capped at 3-5x total return

**Multiple Preferences (2x, 3x)**
- Investor gets 2-3x their investment before common shareholders see anything
- Very aggressive — should be rare; negotiate hard against this

### Anti-Dilution
Protects investors if future rounds happen at a lower valuation ("down round").

**Broad-Based Weighted Average (Standard)**
- Adjusts conversion price using weighted average of old and new prices
- Takes into account the size of the down round relative to the company

**Full Ratchet (Aggressive)**
- Reprices ALL previous shares to the new lower price
- Massively dilutive to founders; avoid if possible

### Dividends
- **Non-cumulative**: Only paid if declared by the board (standard)
- **Cumulative**: Accrue whether or not declared (investor-favorable)
- Most VC-backed companies never pay dividends

## Control Terms

### Board Composition
Determines who controls major decisions.

**Typical Structures:**
- Seed: No formal board, or 2 founders + 1 investor
- Series A: 2 founders + 1 investor + 1 independent
- Series B+: May shift toward investor-favorable composition

### Protective Provisions
Things the company cannot do without investor (preferred stock) approval:
- Issue new equity or debt
- Change the number of board seats
- Sell the company or major assets
- Change the certificate of incorporation
- Declare dividends

### Information Rights
Investors typically get:
- Monthly financial statements
- Annual audited financials (Series A+)
- Annual budget and operating plan
- Cap table access

## Founder-Specific Terms

### Vesting
- Standard: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- Founder vesting is normal and expected — protects all parties
- Acceleration: consider double-trigger (vesting accelerates only if company is acquired AND founder is terminated)

### No-Shop / Exclusivity
- Period during which company cannot solicit other offers (typically 30-60 days)
- Start this clock only when you're ready to close

### Drag-Along Rights
- Majority shareholders can force minority to participate in a sale
- Standard — protects against hold-up problems
