# Comparable Analysis — How to Select and Weight Comps

## Overview
Comparable company analysis (comps) values a startup by comparing it to similar companies that have been publicly valued (public markets) or recently funded (private markets).

## Step 1: Define Comparison Criteria

### Must-Match Criteria
- **Business model**: SaaS vs marketplace vs hardware vs services
- **Revenue stage**: Within 2x of target company's ARR
- **Growth profile**: Similar growth rate (±30%)

### Nice-to-Match Criteria
- Same industry vertical
- Similar target customer (SMB vs enterprise)
- Comparable geographic footprint
- Similar gross margin profile

## Step 2: Source Comparable Companies

### Public Comps Sources
- **Financial data**: Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Koyfin
- **SaaS-specific**: Meritech SaaS Index, Clouded Judgement (Jamin Ball)
- **Sector reports**: BVP Cloud Index, Bessemer Cloud 100

### Private Comps Sources
- **Crunchbase**: Recent funding rounds with reported valuations
- **PitchBook**: Most comprehensive private market data
- **CB Insights**: Unicorn tracker, funding data
- **AngelList / Wellfound**: Early-stage data

## Step 3: Select the Right Multiple

| Business Type | Primary Multiple | Secondary Multiple |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| SaaS (high growth) | EV/ARR | EV/NTM Revenue |
| SaaS (moderate growth) | EV/ARR | EV/EBITDA |
| Marketplace | EV/Revenue (net) | EV/GMV |
| Consumer subscription | EV/Revenue | EV/Monthly Active Users |
| Fintech | EV/Revenue | EV/Gross Profit |

## Step 4: Apply Stage and Liquidity Discounts

### Private Company Discount
- Private companies typically trade at 25-40% discount to public comps
- Higher discount for earlier stage, lower for late-stage/pre-IPO

### Growth Premium/Discount
- Growth above median gets a premium
- Growth below median gets a discount
- Rule of thumb: 1% additional growth ≈ 0.5x additional multiple (for SaaS)

## Step 5: Calculate Valuation Range

```
Low estimate  = Revenue × 25th percentile multiple × (1 - private discount)
Mid estimate  = Revenue × Median multiple × (1 - private discount)
High estimate = Revenue × 75th percentile multiple × (1 - private discount)
```

## Current SaaS Public Market Multiples (2024-2026 Reference)

| Growth Rate | Median EV/NTM Revenue | Range |
|------------|----------------------|-------|
| >40% | 15-20x | Top-tier growth |
| 25-40% | 8-15x | Strong growth |
| 15-25% | 5-10x | Moderate growth |
| <15% | 3-6x | Slow growth |

Note: These benchmarks shift with market conditions. Always check current data.
