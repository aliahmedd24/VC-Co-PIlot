# Competitive Analysis — How to Build a Competitor Matrix

## Step 1: Identify All Competitors

### Direct Competitors
Companies solving the same problem for the same customer.
- Search: product review sites (G2, Capterra), industry reports
- Ask customers: "What else did you evaluate before choosing us?"

### Indirect Competitors
Different approach to the same job-to-be-done.
- Example: Zoom (video meetings) vs business travel (same job: meet with clients)

### Potential Entrants
Adjacent companies that could enter your market.
- Particularly dangerous: companies with large existing customer bases who could add your feature

### Status Quo / Do Nothing
The biggest competitor is often inertia — customers continuing with spreadsheets, email, or manual processes.

## Step 2: Build the Comparison Matrix

### Key Dimensions to Compare
| Dimension | What to Capture |
|-----------|----------------|
| Target customer | Who they sell to (segment, size, industry) |
| Pricing | Model (per seat, usage, flat), price points |
| Key features | Core capabilities, unique features |
| Integrations | Ecosystem compatibility |
| Funding & team | Capital raised, team size, growth signal |
| Market position | Market share, brand recognition, momentum |
| Strengths | What they do best |
| Weaknesses | Where they fall short |

## Step 3: Create a 2x2 Positioning Map

Choose the two dimensions most important to your target customer.

**Common axis pairs:**
- Price vs. Capability
- Ease of use vs. Feature depth
- SMB focus vs. Enterprise focus
- Horizontal (general) vs. Vertical (specialized)

Place yourself in the quadrant that is:
1. Actually true (not aspirational)
2. Valued by your target customer
3. Underserved by existing competitors

## Step 4: Identify Competitive Moats

### Moat Strength Ranking (Strongest → Weakest)
1. **Network effects**: Each new user makes the product more valuable
2. **High switching costs**: Deep integration, data lock-in
3. **Economies of scale**: Lower unit costs at volume
4. **Data advantage**: Proprietary data that improves the product
5. **Brand/trust**: Regulatory certifications, reputation
6. **Counter-positioning**: Incumbents can't copy without self-harm
7. **Process/technology advantage**: Temporary — can be replicated

## Step 5: Monitor Competitive Moves

### What to Track
- New product launches and feature updates
- Pricing changes
- Funding rounds and acquisitions
- Key hires (especially from your company)
- Customer wins/losses
- Marketing messaging changes
- Partnership announcements
