# Startup Failure Modes — Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail (With Data)

Based on CB Insights analysis of 100+ startup post-mortems and multiple industry studies.

## Failure Mode #1: No Market Need (42%)
The number one killer. Building something nobody wants.

**Warning signs:**
- Customer interviews reveal politeness, not enthusiasm
- "Nice to have" feedback vs "I need this yesterday"
- Low organic demand (close rates below 5%)
- Users sign up but don't engage (activation < 30%)

**Mitigations:**
- Conduct 50+ customer discovery interviews before building
- Look for hair-on-fire problems, not mild irritations
- Validate willingness to pay early (pre-sell, LOIs)

## Failure Mode #2: Ran Out of Cash (29%)
Either burned too fast or couldn't raise the next round.

**Warning signs:**
- Burn multiple > 3x (spending $3 for every $1 of new ARR)
- Less than 9 months runway with no fundraise in progress
- Revenue growth decelerating while costs increase
- Key metrics below investor expectations for next round

**Mitigations:**
- Monitor runway weekly
- Start fundraising at 9-12 months runway remaining
- Have a "plan B" for reaching cash-flow positive if raise fails
- Know your break-even point

## Failure Mode #3: Wrong Team (23%)
Missing skills, co-founder conflict, or inability to recruit.

**Warning signs:**
- Co-founders avoiding difficult conversations
- No clear decision-making framework for disagreements
- Key technical or commercial skills completely missing
- Inability to attract strong hires (compensation, vision, or culture issues)

## Failure Mode #4: Outcompeted (19%)
A better-funded or better-positioned competitor wins.

**Warning signs:**
- Competitor raises significantly more capital
- Competitor building same features faster
- Customers mentioning competitor by name during sales calls
- Win rate declining over time

## Failure Mode #5: Pricing / Cost Issues (18%)
Unit economics fundamentally broken.

**Warning signs:**
- Gross margin < 50% (for software)
- CAC > LTV
- CAC payback > 24 months
- Unable to raise prices without losing customers

## Analysis Pattern

When assessing a venture, check each failure mode:
1. Is this failure mode relevant to this venture?
2. What is the current risk level (1-5)?
3. What evidence supports or mitigates this risk?
4. What's the recommended action?
