# Due Diligence Red Flags

Common red flags that experienced investors look for during due diligence. These patterns correlate with higher failure rates and should be flagged proactively.

## Financial Red Flags

### Revenue Quality
- **Customer concentration**: >25% of revenue from a single customer
- **Revenue recognition**: Counting multi-year deals as current-period revenue
- **Vanity metrics**: Reporting bookings or GMV as if it were revenue
- **Non-recurring disguised as recurring**: One-time services bundled into "ARR"
- **Channel dependency**: >50% of revenue from a single channel/partner

### Cash & Burn
- **Accelerating burn without proportional growth**: Spending faster but not growing faster
- **Less than 6 months runway**: Fundraising from a position of desperation
- **Hidden liabilities**: Outstanding convertible notes, deferred compensation, unpaid taxes
- **Inconsistent financials**: Numbers that don't match across pitch deck, model, and bank statements

### Unit Economics
- **Negative gross margin**: Costs more to deliver than you charge (excluding S&M)
- **CAC > LTV**: Acquiring customers at a loss with no path to improvement
- **Payback > 24 months**: Capital-intensive growth that may never reach profitability
- **Declining NRR**: Existing customers are shrinking — a sign of product-market fit erosion

## Team Red Flags

- **Solo non-technical founder** building a technical product
- **Co-founder conflict**: Vague equity splits, unclear decision-making, obvious tension
- **Key person dependency**: All relationships, knowledge, or skills in one person
- **Resume red flags**: Very short tenures (<1 year) across multiple roles, inflated titles
- **Founder-market mismatch**: No domain expertise or connection to the problem
- **Inability to hire**: Can't attract senior talent (signal of weak vision or culture)
- **Advisor overload**: Many advisors, few operators — often compensating for weak team

## Product & Technology Red Flags

- **No moat**: Easy to replicate with a weekend hackathon
- **Platform dependency**: Entire business built on a single API/platform that could change policies
- **Technical debt overload**: Frequent outages, slow development velocity, no automated testing
- **Feature breadth without depth**: Trying to be everything to everyone
- **Security negligence**: No SOC2, no encryption, no access controls for customer data

## Market Red Flags

- **Solution looking for a problem**: Beautiful product that nobody needs
- **Timing risk**: Need 3+ behavioral/regulatory shifts to succeed
- **Winner-take-all dynamics** but you're not first or best-funded
- **Regulatory overhang**: Business model may become illegal or heavily regulated
- **Shrinking TAM**: Market is contracting, not growing

## Go-to-Market Red Flags

- **No clear channel**: "We'll grow virally" without mechanism
- **Pricing confusion**: Can't explain pricing simply or changes pricing frequently
- **Long sales cycles with no enterprise infrastructure**: Trying to sell enterprise without enterprise ops
- **Marketing without measurement**: Spending on brand with no attribution

## Legal & Governance Red Flags

- **Messy cap table**: Unsigned agreements, oral promises, unclear ownership
- **Missing IP assignments**: Contractors or ex-employees who haven't assigned IP
- **Pending litigation**: Undisclosed lawsuits, especially IP-related
- **No 409A valuation**: Required for option grants — absence signals poor governance
- **Related party transactions**: Founder paying family members, sweetheart deals

## Behavioral Red Flags in Founders

- **Evasive answers**: Can't give a straight answer to direct questions
- **Blame externalization**: Every problem is someone else's fault
- **Metrics cherry-picking**: Only shows the best numbers, ignores or hides bad ones
- **Unrealistic optimism**: No scenario where things don't go perfectly
- **Reference reluctance**: Won't provide customer or investor references
- **Lifestyle signals**: Spending on luxury before product-market fit
