# VC Fundamentals

## Round Mechanics

### Pre-Seed ($50K–$500K)
- Instruments: SAFE notes, convertible notes
- Typical terms: Valuation cap $2M–$8M, no discount or 20% discount
- Investors: Angels, micro-funds, accelerators
- What they evaluate: Founder strength, idea clarity, early signal

### Seed ($500K–$3M)
- Instruments: SAFE, priced rounds (increasingly common)
- Typical terms: Pre-money $5M–$15M
- Investors: Seed funds, angels, early-stage VCs
- What they evaluate: Product-market fit signal, early traction, team

### Series A ($5M–$20M)
- Instruments: Priced equity rounds (preferred stock)
- Typical terms: Pre-money $15M–$50M, 1x non-participating liquidation preference
- Investors: Institutional VCs
- What they evaluate: Proven PMF, repeatable revenue engine, unit economics, clear path to $100M ARR

### Series B ($15M–$50M)
- Typical terms: Pre-money $50M–$200M
- Investors: Growth-stage VCs
- What they evaluate: Scalability proof, market leadership trajectory, operating leverage

### Growth/Late ($50M+)
- Typical terms: Pre-money $200M+
- Investors: Growth equity, crossover funds, PE
- What they evaluate: Market dominance, profitability path, expansion opportunity

## Key Term Sheet Concepts

### Liquidation Preferences
- **1x non-participating**: Investors get back their investment OR convert to common (not both). Standard and founder-friendly.
- **1x participating**: Investors get their money back PLUS their pro-rata share of remaining proceeds ("double dip"). Investor-friendly.
- **Multiple (2x, 3x)**: Red flag. Investors get 2-3x their investment before common shareholders see anything.

### Anti-Dilution Provisions
- **Broad-based weighted average**: Standard. Adjusts conversion price based on weighted average of old and new prices.
- **Narrow-based weighted average**: Slightly more investor-favorable. Uses smaller denominator.
- **Full ratchet**: Aggressive. Reprices all previous shares to the new lower price. Avoid.

### Pro-Rata Rights
- Right to maintain ownership percentage in future rounds by investing proportionally.
- Standard for lead investors. Often granted above a minimum check size.

### Board Composition
- Pre-Seed/Seed: Typically no formal board, or founder-controlled
- Series A: Common structure is 2 founders + 1 investor + 1-2 independents
- Series B+: May shift toward 2 founders + 2 investors + 1 independent

## Dilution Math

### Basic Formula
```
Post-money valuation = Pre-money valuation + Investment amount
Founder ownership after = Pre-money / Post-money
```

### Example
- Pre-money: $10M, Investment: $2.5M
- Post-money: $12.5M
- New investor owns: $2.5M / $12.5M = 20%
- Founders diluted from 100% to 80%

### Option Pool Shuffle
- VCs often require an option pool (10-20%) BEFORE the round
- This comes out of founders' share, not investors'
- A 20% option pool on a $10M pre-money means the effective pre-money for founders is $8M

## SAFE Notes (Y Combinator Standard)

### Key Terms
- **Valuation Cap**: Maximum valuation at which the SAFE converts
- **Discount**: Percentage discount to the next round's price (typically 20%)
- **MFN (Most Favored Nation)**: If the company issues a new SAFE with better terms, existing SAFE holders get the better terms
- **Pro-rata right**: Right to participate in the next priced round

### Conversion Mechanics
- SAFEs convert at the LOWER of: (cap / post-money) or (discount applied to round price)
- Post-money SAFEs (standard since 2018): Cap includes the SAFE amount in post-money calculation
- Pre-money SAFEs (legacy): Cap does not include the SAFE itself, creating uncertainty
