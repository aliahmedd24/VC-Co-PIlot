# Market Sizing Frameworks

## TAM / SAM / SOM

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
- **Definition**: Total revenue opportunity if 100% market share, globally
- **Purpose**: Shows the theoretical ceiling and validates the market is worth pursuing
- **Common mistake**: Making TAM too broad ("the $5T healthcare market")

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
- **Definition**: Portion of TAM your product can actually serve (geographic, segment, pricing constraints)
- **Purpose**: Realistic market you could address with current product and go-to-market
- **Example**: TAM = all CRM software, SAM = CRM for mid-market SaaS companies in North America

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
- **Definition**: Realistic market share you can capture in 3-5 years
- **Purpose**: What investors actually care about — the revenue you'll generate
- **Typical SOM**: 1-5% of SAM for most startups in first 5 years

## Sizing Methodologies

### Top-Down
1. Start with industry reports (Gartner, IDC, Statista, Grand View Research)
2. Filter by geography, segment, and product fit
3. Apply market share assumptions

**Pros**: Fast, uses credible data sources
**Cons**: Often too broad, hand-wavy filtering

### Bottom-Up (Preferred by VCs)
1. Count the number of potential customers in your target segment
2. Multiply by your average revenue per account (ARPA)
3. Result = Market size you can credibly capture

**Formula**: # of target customers x ARPA = Market Size

**Example**:
- 50,000 mid-market SaaS companies in NA
- Average deal size: $24,000/year
- SAM = 50,000 x $24,000 = $1.2B

**Pros**: Grounded in specifics, testable assumptions
**Cons**: Requires knowing customer count and pricing

### Value Theory
1. Quantify the economic value your product creates for customers
2. Estimate your fair share of that value (10-30%)
3. Multiply across the customer base

**Example**: Product saves each customer $200K/year, you charge $40K (20% value capture), 30,000 potential customers = $1.2B SAM

## Data Sources for Market Sizing

### Free / Low-Cost
- **Statista**: Industry statistics and forecasts
- **Census Bureau / BLS**: Establishment counts by NAICS code
- **SEC Filings**: Public company revenues, segment breakdowns
- **Crunchbase**: Funding data, company counts by category
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: Company counts by filters

### Premium
- **Gartner Magic Quadrants**: Market definitions and sizing
- **IDC MarketScape**: Technology market forecasts
- **PitchBook**: Private market data, valuations
- **CB Insights**: Industry reports, trend analysis

## Credibility Checklist for Market Sizing

1. **Is the bottom-up math shown?** (not just "Gartner says $50B")
2. **Are customer counts sourced?** (LinkedIn, census, industry associations)
3. **Is pricing validated?** (based on actual or comparable pricing)
4. **Is the segment specific?** (not "all SMBs" but "SaaS companies with 50-500 employees in North America")
5. **Are growth rates justified?** (historical CAGR, tailwinds, expansion potential)
6. **Is there a wedge strategy?** (start narrow, expand into adjacent segments)

## Market Expansion Patterns

### Adjacent Market Expansion
- Start in a niche (beachhead), prove value, expand to adjacent segments
- Example: Slack started with tech teams → expanded to all knowledge workers

### Geographic Expansion
- Prove model in one market → replicate in similar markets
- Consider: Regulatory, cultural, competitive differences

### Product-Led Expansion
- Core product → add-ons → platform
- Example: HubSpot: CRM → Marketing Hub → Sales Hub → Service Hub → CMS

### Upstream / Downstream
- Move up-market (SMB → Enterprise) or down-market (Enterprise → SMB)
- Different go-to-market, pricing, and product requirements for each
