# Lean Canvas — Deep Guide

## Overview
The Lean Canvas is a 1-page business model adapted from Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas by Ash Maurya. It replaces Key Partners, Key Activities, Key Resources, and Customer Relationships with Problem, Solution, Key Metrics, and Unfair Advantage — making it more actionable for startups.

## Block-by-Block Guide

### 1. Problem (Start Here)
List the top 1-3 problems your customer segment faces.

**How to validate problems:**
- Conduct 20+ customer discovery interviews
- Ask "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]"
- Listen for frequency (daily/weekly/monthly) and severity (annoying vs blocking)
- Look for existing workarounds — active workarounds = real pain

**Good problem statement example:**
"Mid-market SaaS CFOs spend 8+ hours per week manually reconciling billing data across 3-5 systems, leading to delayed financial closes and 5-10% revenue leakage from billing errors."

**Bad problem statement example:**
"Companies have billing problems" (too vague, no quantification)

### 2. Customer Segments
Define your early adopter — the customer who has this problem most acutely.

**Early adopter characteristics:**
- Has the problem frequently and severely
- Is actively looking for a solution
- Has budget and authority to buy
- Is willing to try imperfect solutions
- Can provide valuable feedback

**Template:** "[Job title] at [company type] who [specific situation]"
Example: "VP Finance at Series B+ SaaS companies with 500-5000 customers who are still using spreadsheets for revenue recognition"

### 3. Unique Value Proposition
A single, clear, compelling message that states why you are different and worth buying.

**Formula:** "[End result customer wants] + [Specific period of time] + [Address the objections]"
Example: "Close your books in 2 days instead of 2 weeks — no implementation project required"

### 4. Solution
Map each problem to a solution feature (not a feature list — solutions to specific problems).

### 5. Channels
How do you reach your early adopter?

**Free channels:** Content marketing, SEO, community, partnerships, open source
**Paid channels:** Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, conferences, outbound SDRs
**Product-led:** Freemium, free trial, referral program

### 6. Revenue Streams
How do you make money? Define pricing model and initial price point.

### 7. Cost Structure
List your biggest cost items. For most startups: salaries, hosting, tools.

### 8. Key Metrics
The AARRR metrics most relevant to your stage (see KPI Dashboard agent for details).

### 9. Unfair Advantage
Something that cannot be easily copied or bought. Network effects, proprietary data, domain expertise, regulatory advantages, community.

## Iteration Pattern
1. Fill out Canvas v1 based on assumptions
2. Identify riskiest assumption (highest impact if wrong)
3. Design cheapest experiment to test it
4. Run experiment (1-2 weeks)
5. Update Canvas with learnings
6. Repeat from step 2
