# Slide Frameworks — Pitch Deck Slide Types and Best Practices

## The Problem Slide

### What Makes a Great Problem Slide
- **Specific**: "CFOs at SaaS companies with 500+ customers spend 8 hours/week on manual reconciliation"
- **Quantified**: Dollar value of pain, time wasted, opportunity cost
- **Validated**: Customer quotes, survey data, industry research
- **Urgent**: Getting worse, not better

### Anti-Patterns
- ❌ "The market is big and growing" (not a problem statement)
- ❌ Listing 5+ problems (too diffuse — focus on top 1-2)
- ❌ Abstract language without specifics

## The Solution Slide

### Structure
1. One-sentence value prop
2. Product screenshot or demo flow (3-4 steps)
3. Key differentiator vs. status quo

### Tips
- Show, don't tell — a screenshot is worth 1000 words
- Focus on outcomes: "reduces close time from 2 weeks to 2 days"
- Don't list features — that's a different slide

## The Traction Slide

### The Most Important Slide After Series Seed

**What to show:**
- Revenue growth chart (MRR or ARR)
- Key engagement metrics with trends
- Customer logos (recognizable > quantity)
- Cohort retention curves

### Power Moves
- Show month-over-month growth rate alongside the curve
- Include a "milestone timeline" showing key achievements and dates
- Customer quote that captures why they love the product

## The Market Slide

### Structure
- TAM → SAM → SOM funnel (nested circles or concentric rings)
- Bottom-up math shown, not just headline numbers
- Growth rate with credible source

### Tips
- Lead with SOM (what you'll actually capture) — investors care about this most
- Show the expansion path: "Start with X, expand to Y"
- Source every number

## The Competition Slide

### The 2x2 Matrix
- Choose axes that makes YOUR positioning clear (in an underserved quadrant)
- Include 5-8 competitors max
- Don't put yourself in the top-right corner of everything (unbelievable)

### Alternative: Feature Comparison Table
| Feature | You | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Core feature | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Differentiator | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## The Team Slide

### What to Include
- Headshot (professional, consistent style)
- Name and title
- ONE relevant accomplishment (most impressive prior company, specific achievement)
- Advisor names with logos of their companies

### What NOT to Include
- Exhaustive bios
- Non-relevant experience
- Team members who aren't in leadership roles

## The Ask Slide

### Structure
1. How much you're raising
2. What key milestones this round enables (3-4 bullet points)
3. Use of funds breakdown (pie chart or simple breakdown)
4. Target metrics at next round

### Use of Funds Best Practices
- Allocate to outcomes, not departments: "Build sales team to reach $5M ARR" not "50% to sales"
- Show 18-24 months of runway
- Don't allocate to G&A or rent — investors assume those are covered
