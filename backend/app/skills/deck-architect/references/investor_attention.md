# Investor Attention Patterns — What VCs Look At First

## Time Allocation Data (DocSend Research)

Average time spent per pitch deck: **3 minutes 44 seconds**

### Time Per Slide Type
| Slide | % of Time | Avg Seconds | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Financials | 23.2% | ~52s | Most scrutinized — must be defensible |
| Team | 14.4% | ~32s | Second most — credentials matter |
| Product | 12.6% | ~28s | Must be instantly clear |
| Business Model | 11.8% | ~26s | How you make money |
| Market | 10.2% | ~23s | Size and growth |
| Competition | 7.5% | ~17s | Quick positioning check |
| Purpose | 6.7% | ~15s | Why this exists |
| Traction | 5.8% | ~13s | Glanced if pre-revenue |
| Other | 7.8% | ~17s | Varies |

## Key Findings

### What Gets More Attention (Success Signals)
- Decks that receive funding have **20% more time spent on each slide** on average
- VCs spend **2x more time on financials** for companies they fund
- Team slide gets disproportionate attention at pre-seed/seed (30%+ of time)

### What Gets Skipped
- Mission/vision statements (unless very compelling)
- Appendix slides (rarely viewed — put critical info in main deck)
- Technology architecture (unless deep-tech)

## Viewing Patterns

### First Pass (60 seconds)
VCs typically:
1. Title slide (5 seconds — company name, tagline)
2. Skip to Team (10 seconds — do I know anyone? impressive backgrounds?)
3. Skip to Traction/Financials (15 seconds — is there real traction?)
4. Product slide (10 seconds — do I understand what this does?)
5. Decision to read more carefully or pass

### Deep Pass (remaining 2-3 minutes)
If they continue:
1. Read through sequentially
2. Pause on financials (check assumptions)
3. Return to team slide
4. Check market sizing methodology
5. Review competition positioning

## Optimization Recommendations

### Based on Attention Data
1. **Put key metrics on every slide** — VCs are scanning, not reading
2. **Financial slide must be defensible** — it gets the most scrutiny
3. **Team slide should have logos** — visual recognition is faster than reading bios
4. **Product slide needs a screenshot** — abstract descriptions get skipped
5. **Keep it under 15 slides** — attention drops sharply after slide 12

### Deck Delivery Format
- **PDF over PowerPoint** for initial sharing (consistent rendering)
- **Use a tracking link** (DocSend, Dropbox DocSend) to see which slides get attention
- **Avoid links in the deck** that take the viewer away
- **File size under 10MB** — large files get abandoned
- **Send on Tuesday or Wednesday morning** — highest open rates

### Follow-Up Triggers
VCs are most likely to respond when:
- They view the deck within 24 hours of receiving it
- They spend more than 3 minutes total
- They revisit the financials slide
- They forward to a partner (DocSend can track this)
