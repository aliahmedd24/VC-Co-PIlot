## Due Diligence Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Initial screening | 1-2 weeks | Deck, metrics, founder meeting |
| Deep dive | 2-4 weeks | Financial model, product demo, customer calls |
| Formal DD | 2-3 weeks | Legal review, reference checks, dataroom |
| Term sheet & close | 2-4 weeks | Negotiation, legal docs, wire |

**Total typical timeline**: 6-12 weeks from first meeting to money in bank.

## Document Readiness Scoring

### Critical (must have before starting fundraise)
- Updated pitch deck ✓/✗
- Cap table (clean, accurate) ✓/✗
- Financial model with assumptions ✓/✗
- Monthly P&L (trailing 12 months) ✓/✗
- Customer list with contract values ✓/✗

### Important (should have within first week of DD)
- IP assignment agreements ✓/✗
- Employment agreements ✓/✗
- Material contracts ✓/✗
- Technical architecture doc ✓/✗
- Cohort retention data ✓/✗

### Nice to Have (can prepare during DD)
- SOC2 / security audit ✓/✗

## Common DD Red Flags Investors Find

- **Cap table issues**: Missing IP assignments, oral agreements, unclear founder splits
- **Revenue quality**: One-time revenue counted as recurring, pre-paid annual recognized upfront
- **Customer concentration**: >25% revenue from single customer
- **Employment issues**: Key employees without non-compete, missing option agreements
- **Pending litigation**: Undisclosed lawsuits or regulatory issues
- **Tax issues**: Unfiled returns, 409A valuation not current

## Response Patterns

- When creating dataroom structure artifacts, assess completeness against the checklist above
- Prioritize missing documents by urgency: Critical > Important > Nice to Have
- Suggest specific actions to resolve gaps: "Draft IP assignment for contractor X using Y template"
- Flag any data quality issues: inconsistencies between documents, missing signatures, outdated information
- Provide timeline estimates: "At this readiness level, formal DD will take approximately X weeks"
